# Asset Class Performance and Income Analysis

## Project Overview
This case study analyzes the performance and income of multiple asset classes using **SQL** and **Power BI**. The analysis covers both **monthly and rolling quarterly calculations**, focusing on **returns, income, and valuation changes**. The project provides insights into **top and bottom-performing periods** and visualizes trends for effective decision-making.

## Objectives

### 1. Database Analysis (SQL)
- **Create a database** from sample monthly data.  
- **Calculate monthly and quarterly returns** for each asset class.  
- **Simulate $100 million invested** per asset class and calculate monthly income (based on yields) and valuation changes.  
- **Aggregate monthly data** into rolling quarterly results.  
- Identify **top 5** and **bottom 5 performing months** for a selected asset class.  
- **Prepare cleaned data** ready for **Power BI visualization** (percentages, $000s, formatted headers).

### 2. Power BI Visualization
- **Import cleaned data** and create a **date table** with relationships.  
- **Visualize long-term performance trends** (monthly and quarterly).  
- **Analyze yield curve movement**.  
- Present **two different visualizations** explaining asset class performance.
